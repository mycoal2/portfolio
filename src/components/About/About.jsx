            Hello! My name is Michael and I am a gamer that has taken interest in programming.
            It all started when I was old enough to spend all my time on the computers.
            My passion emerged from all the websites and games I played and tried to understand how they were made.
            </p>
            <p className="pb-5">
            I am currently in my third year for my bachelors in <span className="text-green-600">COMPUTER ENGINEERING</span>.
            I am proficient in C++, Java, Javascript, React.js, Node.js, but what I am most confident in is my ability to learn and adapt fast.
            </p>

            <p>
            In my spare time I play games, work on personal game projects or play sports like volleyball, badminton and rock climbing.
